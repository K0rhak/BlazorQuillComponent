# Blazor Quill Component

Blazor Quill Component is a custom reusable control that allows us to easily consume Quill and place multiple instances of it on a single page in our Blazor application.

Also, it will allow us to implement the following features:

- Exports editor contents in Text, HTML, and Quill’s native Delta format
- Allows initial content to be set declaratively in the control or programmatically
- Provides a read only mode, suitable for displaying Quill’s native Delta format
- Allows custom toolbars to be defined
- Allows custom themes
- Has an inline editor mode that also allows custom toolbars

## What is Quill?
Quill is a free, [open source](https://github.com/quilljs/quill/) WYSIWYG editor built for the modern web. With its [modular architecture](https://quilljs.com/docs/modules/) and expressive [API](https://quilljs.com/docs/api/), it is completely customizable to fit any need.
